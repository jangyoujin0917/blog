## Syntax
#### Morphological complexity
- Agglutinative : morphemes loosely jointed
	- morpheme → one meaning
	- Korean, Hungarian, Swahili
- Fusional : affixes not easily separated
	- morpheme → several meanings
	- Spanish (-o : first-person singular present)
- Polysynthetic : highly complex words
	- Sora (anin-ɲam-jɔ-te-n : He is catching fish.)
#### PS trees
- Creativity : can make infinite sentences with finite rules
- Constituents : natural grouping in a sentence
- Constituency tests
	1. "stand alone test" : ex. A puppy.
	2. "replacement by pronoun/do"
	3. "move as a unit"
- Structural ambiguity (↔ Lexical ambiguity : bank, ring, right, ...)
	- ex. Sue saw the man with the telescope
- Syntactic categories
	- Phrasal categories : NP, VP, AP, PP, AdvP
	- Lexical categories : N, V, P, A, Adv
- PS trees
	- S → NP VP / NP → Det N / VP → V NP
	- VP → V / VP → V PP / PP → P NP
	- VP → V CP / CP → C S (Complementizers : if, whether)

#### X-bar schema
- Head : the core of a phrase, same syntactic type (N in NP, V in VP)
- Complement : other sister categories, optional
- Specifier : element preceding the head
![[X-bar schema.png]]
- Cross-linguistic differences : head-initial / head-final languages
- Adjunt : sister of X-bar and daughter of X-bar; optional
- Tense Phrases : sentences can be refered to TP
	- TP → NP $\overline{\text{T}}$, $\overline{\text{T}}$ → T VP
	- T contains modal/tense (ex. +pst, can)
- Subject-Verb Agreement (structure-dependent)
- Yes-no question : Auxiliary verb inversion (Move aux of main clause)
- Wh-Questions : wh-phrase move leftwards, out of main body
![[X-bar WH.png]]
- Universal Grammar (UG) : common to all L (basic design of human L)
- Parameters : cross-linguistic differences
- Nativists view : children born with UG → fix parameters quickly
## Semantics
- Reference : word with real-world object
	- Proper names (no sense)
- Sense : mental representations of their meaning
	- hobbits, unicorn, Harry Potter (no reference)
- Lexical relations
	1. Synonyms : same meaning (boy/lad)
	2. Antonyms : opposite
		- Complementary : alive/dead
		- Gradable : big/small
		- Relational : give/receive
	3. Homonyms(homophones) : pronounced same (bear/bare)
	4. Polysemous : multiple meanings (diamond : shape, baseball field)
	5. Hyponymy : general-specific relation (dog[hypernym] - poodle[hyponym])
- Meaning (Truth conditions)
	- Semantic Rule 1 : if meaning of NP is a member of meaning of VP → true.
	- Semantic Rule 2 : establishes the meaning of VP
		- Set of individuals who like Laura. (Steve 'likes Laura')
	- Anomaly : semantic violations (Colorless green ideas sleep furiously.)
	- Metaphors : seem anomalous, can be understood in meaningful concept (Time is money.)
	- Idioms : cannot be predicted based on original meanings (put one's foot in one's mouth)
- Semantic features - part of word meanings
	- Evidence : speech errors
	- Nouns
		- Morphologically marked ('-ess' : female)
		- May have syntactic/semantic effects (count noun/mass noun)
	- Verbs
		- Have syntactic consequences (Eventives / Statives)
		- Negative Polarity Items : expressions require negative elements
			- ever, anymore, have a red cent
- Thematic roles
	- Agent : 'doer' of the action (*The boy* rolled the red ball)
	- Theme : 'undergoer' of the action (The boy rolled *the red ball*)
	- Goal : 'endpoint' (The boy rolled the red ball to *the girl*)
	- Source : 'initiator' (Mary bought the book from *John*)
	- Experiencer (*Mary* fears thunder)
	- Stimulus (Mary fears *thunder*)
	- Patient : 'undergoer' of the effect of action, state change (Sue mowed *the lawn*)
	- Instrument : the means (Sue mowed the lawn with *lawn mower*)
## Pragmatics
- Extra-truth-conditional meanings
- Deictic words (pronouns, demonstratives, adverbs, prepositions)
	- Linguistic context : already uttered (Antecedent)
		- Reflexive pronoun (-self/-selves) : antecedent in same clause
		- Otherwise, antecedent in different clause
	- Situational context : gestures, world knowledge
- Implicature : inference from utterance based on context
- Maxims of Discourse
	- Maxim of Quality: Truth
	- Maxim of Quantity: Information
	- Maxim of Relation: Relevance
	- Maxim of Manner: Clarity
- Speech Acts (bet, challenge, fine, nominate) 등의 선언
## Child language acquisition
#### Nativists vs Behaviourists
- Poverty of Stimulus
	- Child access only finite data. (Input is impoverished)
	- Children understand structural dependency.
	- Nativist - innate Language Acquisition Device (LAD), universal grammar (UG). 

| Nature (Nativists)     | Nurture (Behaviourists)     |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Universal Grammar      | Blank state (Tabular Rasa)  |
| input is impoverished  | linguistic input            |
| specialized mechanisms | imitation and reinforcement |
- Misconception
	1. Child is not good at imitations
	2. Adults don't correct 'bad grammar'
	3. Children ignore corrections/negative reinforcement
	4. No error like this: “I painted a barn red” → \*“I saw a barn red”
- Language is complex cognitive system. Not fully acquired by general learning principles(behaviourist's view).
#### What is critical for CLA?
- Critical period : a biologically determined period exists during which language acquisition must occur (ex. Genie discovered at 13y)
- CDS (motherese) : child-directed speech
	- Higher pitch, slower, less complex
	- Facilitative role, not a driving force
- Social interaction is needed (ex. Jim, only watched TV)
- Other theory : children' desire to communicate, ability to read speaker's intentions...
#### Speech development
- Infant are born with prior knowledge (remember they heard in womb)
- Universal listeners (until about 6m) → tuned to native language
- Anatomical differences (immature motor control)
- Babbling (about 6m) : easy consonant → contain ambient language
- First words (1y) : differ from adults', fixed sound-meaning pairing
- Acquisition of Phonology
	- common sound → less common sound + also frequency matters
	- Disparity btw speech production and representation.
	- Developmental speech errors
		- Substitution (2~4y)
			- Fronting (consonant more fronted): pig [pɪd]
			- Stopping (produce a stop): sausage [tɒtɪd]
			- Voicing errors: tap [dæp]
			- Gliding ([l]/[r] → [w]/[j]): rabbit [wæbɪt] (until 6;0)
		- Assimilation
			- Syllable reduplication: bottle [bɒbɒ] (until 2;6)
		- Deletion (2~4y)
			- Final consonant deletion: ball [ba]
			- Syllable deletion: balloon [lun]
			- Consonant cluster reduction: stop [top] (2~5y)
		- Vowel epenthesis : black [bəlæk] (less common)
	- Errors are phonological process, but not possible to explain all of them. (Variability)
#### Lexical development
- Early lexicon : a lot of nouns (people, food, body parts, clothing, ...)
- Cross-linguistic variation
	- Korean : both nouns and verbs are dominant
	- Why? SOV, verb instead of preposition
- Vocabulary spurt : fast rate of learning vocabulary after 50-word milestone
- Mapping problem → gradually modified
	- The whole object assumption: word refer to whole object
	- Mutual exclusivity assumption: things should have only one label
	- Word extension is based on physical attributes. (not color)
	- Overextension (ex. dog for four legged animals)
	- Underextension (ex. car only for family automobile)
- Joint attention (shared focus of two individuals) - helps word learning
	- Children track someone's locus of attention
#### Morphosyntactic development
- Rule-governed nature (tested by the Wug Test)
- The acquisition of syntax
	- Holophrastic stage (from 12m)
		- Single words (often used to mean complex ideas)
	- Two word stage (from 18m) - emergence of syntax
		- Unanalysed combinations : multiple words, but children combine it (ex. "Iwant", "Idunno")
		- Linguistic unit is combined expressing a semantic relation
	- Telegraphic stage (from 24m)
		- Functional categories omitted form (He go out)
			- Cognitive limitations on the length of utterance
		- Usually imperatives, affirmative, declarative → later questions and negations
		- Also uses single word utterances
		- They may still understand grammatical categories.
	- The multi-word stage (from 30m)
		- Begin to produce complex structures
- MLU = \# of morphemes / \# of utterances
- Learning grammatical morphemes
	- They were mastered gradually (from two-word stage to about 50 months).
	- Rate is different, but order that acquired is very similar
- Language comprehension
	- Children(17m) - sensitivity to word order
	- Children(21~28m) - more good understanding when heard grammatical sentence.
	- Cross-linguistic differences
		- Freer word order → children learn system relatively early.
		- By 3y, Korean children use grammatical morpheme.
- The acquisition of pragmatics
	- Pronouns - Children(2y) have difficulty using 'you' and 'I' correctly
	- Implicatures : inferences
	- Scalar inferences (Children < Adults)
		- You can buy a car *or* a boat (meaning : not both)
#### Other cognitive abilities
- Communication before language
	- Gestures, due to shared intentionality
	- Social cognitive abilities (intention reading, joint attention) help communication → play a role in language acquisition and use
- Theory of mind : ability to understand other's intention, desires, emotions, ...
## Language processing and the brain
- Speech perception
	- "Categorical perception" : different sound, same category
	- Variability : within-talker, between-talker
		- Accents : isogloss(언어학적 특징 지리 경계선)
	- Bottom-Up vs Top-Down
		- Acoustic input / Words / Structure / meaning & context
		- Phoneme restoration effect : perceptual illusion that they hear missing speech sound
		- Flexibility (both processing is used)
			- bottom-up is insufficient (bg noise, foreign accent)
			- top-down is vague (indecisive context)
	- Lexical access and word recognition
		- Word frequency effect : more frequent → accessed quickly
		- Semantic priming (faciliation) : more relevant → accessed quickly
		- Lexical ambiguity : Primes both “hand” and ”tree” (activation for tree quickly diminishes..)
	- Syntactic processing
		- Parsing ("Garden path" sentences : contain a temporal ambiguity)
		- Minimal attachment (바로 앞과 연결) / Late closure (clause를 늦게 닫음, 바로 앞 clause와 연결)
		- Prosody, word frequency도 고려됨
- Human brain
	- Broca's aphasia (Speech production)
		- Slow, laborious and nonfluent speech
		- Impaired production of closed-class elements (e.g., articles, auxiliary verbs, prepositions, other function words)
		- Relatively intact understanding of colloquial conversation
	- Wernicke's aphasia (Speech Comprehension)
		- Fluent speech with good intonation (sometimes excessively so), but make no sense
		- Distortions of phonological structures of words
		- Impaired understanding of speech
	- Broca's aphasia (Syntactic/Semantic processing)
		- difficulties understanding syntactically complex sentences
	- Now, language involve large networks of brain regions (both H, but left-lateralized)
	- Modular mind
		- Specific Language Impairment (SLI)
			- Disorder that children fail to develop L
			- delay of deficit in grammatical knowledge
			- Genetic basis to SLI
		- However, SLI has non-linguistic deficits
			- Perception of rapid stimuli
			- Working memory, Reasoning, Visual imagery
		- KE family (FOXP2 - Language gene?)
			- Also has non-linguistic problem
			- Animals also have FOXP2 gene.
	- Neurolinguistics - Nowadays
		- Understand process of L comprehension (EEG)
		- Language use causes brain (Bilinguals show larger grey matter volume)
		- What areas are activated when using L
